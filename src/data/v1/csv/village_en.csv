As its name suggests, it rains almost constantly in Amegakure and the surrounding area. All the water seemingly ends in a large lake that surrounds the village. 
Ame ninja are said to be notoriously short tempered, while their village trains them to their fullest potential, resulting in the creation of many original techniques. Ame is frequently hired for assassination missions, an area of expertise prized by many countries. A common trait of shinobi from this village is wearing rebreathers. Its shinobi also have a propensity for genjutsu.";amegakure.png;amegakure_symbol.svg

It is surrounded by a forest of bamboo, and as such most of the village's buildings and goods are made out of bamboo. Because it is such a remote village, the villagers received aid from the Lightning Group in the past. When the Lightning Group came into conflict with Kirigakure, its surviving members sought refuge in Bamboo Village. The villagers refused to help them, fearing reprisal from Kiri. Years later, this rejection of the Lightning Group causes Bamboo Village to be attacked by the Dark Thunder Group, but the village is saved by Sasuke Uchiha.;bamboo_village.png;
3;Ceramic Village;陶の里;Chori no Sato;Ceramic Village;The Ceramic Village;"The Ceramic Village (陶の里, Chori no Sato) was a small village in the Land of Wind, near the border with the Land of Rivers. The area surrounding the village was not as barren as most of the country, being well-forested. Per its name, the village was famous for its ceramics, the clay for which was gathered from the surrounding area. Ceramic tiles adorned all of the village's buildings and tall chimneys for kilns were common throughout.
The Ceramic Village was historically led by a family of ""Ceramics Gods"" (??, Chori Kami), who lived in a large mansion in the village's centre. These Ceramics Gods gathered the best innovations of the village's ceramists and kept them safe, kept them secret. These Ceramics Gods also tended to dictate the village's artistic standards. Under Mash?, the village became famous for its Hanasaki style, marked by its simple appearance yet exquisite beauty. When the special clay used for Hanasaki started to run out, Mash? was unwilling to compromise his artistic standards, threatening to ruin the village once the clay inevitably ran out.
To save the village, Mash?'s son, G?sh?, secretly killed his father and all the other Hanasaki ceramists, telling everyone they'd abandoned the village. He hid the remaining supply of Hanasaki clay, forcing the village to pursue new art styles. Under G?sh?, the village's ceramics became extremely ornate, luxurious, and colorful. Although the village prospered, gathering much more fame and business than it ever had before, some believed its new ceramics had no artistic value. G?sh? didn't consider this a problem, feeling that art that didn't sell wasn't worth pursuing.
Ten years after Mash?'s death, Sasori and Deidara of Akatsuki travelled to Ceramic Village to seek out the clay used in the Hanasaki style. In the course of doing so the village was destroyed by Deidara's C2. Only Kany?, the last practitioner of Hanasaki, survived.";;

However, each time relations worsened between the larger villages, Takumi was attacked by one village over fear of their ninja tools crossing to the other village. Yet they still had to curry aid with the larger villages to survive. Over time, their clientele from the other villages grew in skill, making the crafted weapons obsolete. When the village faced hard times they requested help but were ignored. Certain skilled Takumi villagers grew resentful and felt the villages didn't respect them for all the help their weapons provided in the past, having repaid their aid with attacks in the past.;takumi_village.png;takumi_village_symbol.svg

Like the country in which it resides, Yugakure has strong inclinations towards pacifism. After years of reluctantly offering combat-related services, Yugakure officially transitioned away from the typical shinobi missions; it prides itself as the ""village that has forgotten wars"" (??????, Ikusa o Wasureta Sato). The village's ninja now work almost exclusively within the Land of Hot Water's borders, keeping the roads safe for tourists and performing odd-jobs for the many small settlements around the country.
Yugakure's transformation from a military force was not supported by all, Hidan being a notable objector. A follower of Jashin, Hidan believed violence was good, even necessary; when he couldn't convince the village to change its ways, he became a missing-nin, slaughtering many of his fellow Yu-nin before he left. In Konoha Shinden, critics of Yugakure's pacifism decry it as ""Nurumayugakure"" (??????, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Warm Water). In Sasuke Shinden, Yugakure's ninja acknowledge a flaw in its pursuit of peace, as the village has historically tended to ignore difficult subjects in order to avoid getting involved, Jashinists and the Chinoike clan being more glaring examples.
Yugakure is surrounded by several different hotsprings, and so thick steam rises up around the village. Many resort hotels are built throughout the area for the hotsprings' visitors to stay in.";yugakure.png;yugakure_symbol.svg
